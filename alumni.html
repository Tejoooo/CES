          Time and again, the responsibility of handling CES operations are handed over to a new person and I had the privilege of doing it this year. I am really honoured to be a part of 
          such a diverse and talented team from whom I learn so much. CES is more like a family to me i get to meet some very awesome people who were a part of CES when they were in college 
          and still are closely bonded. I hope I am able to serve you all as expected. Meet me, Shlok Raval, the HEAD of CES and my wonderful team!
